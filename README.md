# Java-Calculator
The Java calculator project I developed using AWT and Swing is a simple yet functional application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.

The calculator features a user-friendly interface with buttons for digits, decimal points, and operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes an equal sign for computing results and a clear button for resetting the input. The application employs event handling to process user input and accurately calculate the desired mathematical operations. With its straightforward design and intuitive functionality, the Java calculator serves as an accessible tool for performing quick calculations within the Java environment.
